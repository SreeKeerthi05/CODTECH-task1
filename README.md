OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT: SMART LIGHT CONTROL

 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to design a system using LED and a microcontroller. Here the bulbs are glown based on the light dependent resistor[LDR]. The components used in the project are Aurdino,LDR,resistors,LED'S,connecting wires,and a bread board.

 KEY ACTIVITIES

 The key activity of the project is that the light starts glowing when there is darkness and the light stops glowing when there is no darkness.The reason is that here we have used an LDR i.e, Light dependent resistor which activates when sunlight falls on it.

 EXTENSION:

 Here we can use a timer and set a particular time limit to the light so that the light[bulb] glows based on that.For example,6pm-6am  Excatly at evening 6pm the bulb starts glowing and continues to glow until 6am the next day.
